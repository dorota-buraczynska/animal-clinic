> TEMPLATE EXERCISE
 
This is my first template exercise. <br> 
I read somewhere that at the beginning the best way to learn how to make websites is to find one that you like and try to recreate it on your own. So I did it and this is the result of my work.

I modeled my website after free template which I found on https://pl.wix.com/

## You can find here:

1. Automatic slideshow with ability of changing sliders manually 
2. Scrolling navigation
3. Google map
4. Accordion
5. Model box
6. Multi-step form with validation 
7. jQuery UI datepicker extended with additional functionalities
